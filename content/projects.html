            like react or node.js.

        <p >Another project I have in the works is an organization app built using
            .NET, it's a project that I really have enjoyed working on and felt a need
            for. I personally have a tough time keeping track of things and this was
            meant to be something to help me.

        <h2>Graphics Engine</h2>
        <p >A big project I am currently undertaking is creating my own
            graphics engine using Vulkan. This current project is in it's infant steps with myself really
            only creating the window and setting up logical and physcial devices. I am thinking about swapping
            over to OpenGL in order to teach myself a more simple version before deep diving into Vulkan.
