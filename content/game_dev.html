    <h3>First time learning</h3>
    <p>During my first dozen or so hours of learning godot I had a lot of fun following a bunch of different tutorials
        that involved things like buiilding a character controller or an inventory system using its built in scripting languages
        GDScript.

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top: 50px;">
        However I quickly learned that you can use C# to program with Godot as well and thought that I might try my hand at 
        using that language instead. So I quickly shifted from GDScript to a language I was more comftorable with.

        This did not come without headaches though as the Godot engine can be a bit more difficult to use when not using the 
        language that it was meant to be used for. As well as the fact that Godot as an engine has mainly been used as a 2D
        game engine and only recently became more popular for 3D game developers to use.
