    <p>As a dedicated computer science student at SCSU, I am passionate about programming and proficient in languages 
        like C#, C++, and Python. Currently expanding my skill set, I'm diving into web development with HTML, CSS, and 
        JavaScript. Beyond the digital realm, I find joy in the culinary arts, exploring the world of cooking. Alongside 
        my academic pursuits, I immerse myself in game development, actively crafting a 3D game using the versatile  
        platform Godot.</p>
